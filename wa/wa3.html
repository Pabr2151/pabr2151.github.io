<h2> <center> <id= "subsection1"> History </id> </center> </h2>
    <center> <p> In 1969, Waterville Valley Ski Area in New Hampshire, formed the first freestyle instruction program, making the resort the birthplace of freestyle skiing. 
        The following year, Corcoran and Doug Pfeiffer, organized the first National Open Championships of Freestyle Skiing on the Sunnyside trails. 
        In 1971, Waterville Valley Hosted the first Professional Freestyle Skiing Competition, which attracted freestyle skiing legends to Waterville Valley.
        Some of these competitors, such as Wayne Wong, Floyd Wilkie, and George Askevold, stayed at Waterville Valley as coaches of the first Freestyle Ski Team. </p> <br> </center>

<h3> <center> <id= "subsection3"> Aerial Skiing </id> </center> </h3>
    <center> <p> Aerialists ski off 2-4 meter jumps, that propel them up to 6 meters in the air (which can be up to 20 meters above the landing height,
         given the landing slope). Once in the air, aerialists perform multiple flips and twists before landing on a 34 to 39-degree inclined landing hill
         about 30 meters in length. The top male aerialists can currently perform triple back flips with up to four or five twists. Aerial skiing is a judged sport,
         and competitors receive a score based on jump takeoff (20%), jump form (50%) and landing (30%). A degree of difficulty (DOD) is then factored in for a total score.
         Skiers are judged on a cumulative score of LIMA two jumps. These scores do not generally carry over to the next round.
         Aerialists train for their jumping maneuvers during the summer months by skiing on specially constructed water ramps and landing in a large swimming pool.
         An example of this is the Utah Olympic Park training facility. A water ramp consists of a wooden ramp covered with a special plastic mat that when lubricated
         with sprinklers allows an athlete to ski down the ramp towards a jump. The skier then skis off the wooden jump and lands safely in a large swimming pool.
         A burst of air is sent up from the bottom of the pool just before landing to break up the surface tension of the water, thus softening the impact of the landing.
         Skiers sometimes reinforce the skis that they use for water-ramping with 6mm of fiberglass or cut holes in the front and back in order to soften the impact when
         landing properly on their skis.</p> </center>

<h3> <center> <id= "subsection4"> Slopestyle </id> </center> </h3>
    <center> <p> Slopestyle is a winter sport in which athletes ski or snowboard down a course including a variety of obstacles including rails, jumps and other terrain park features.
         Points are scored for amplitude, originality and quality of tricks. The discipline has its roots in action sports like skateboarding and BMX and has very successfully crossed
         over into the snow sports worlds of skiing and snowboarding.[1] Skiers use Twin-tip skis for their symmetry since they often go large portions of the course backward (referred to as "switch")
         and for their balanced weight so as to not destabilize spins. Slopestyle tricks fall mainly into four categories: spins, grinds, grabs and flips, and most tricks done in competition are a
         combination of these.In slopestyle, athletes ski or snowboard down a course including a variety of obstacles including rails, jumps,
         and other terrain park features. Points are scored for amplitude, originality and quality of tricks.[10] Twin-tip skis are used and
         are particularly useful if the skier lands backwards. Slopestyle tricks fall mainly into four categories: spins, grinds, grabs and flips.
         Slopestyle became an Olympic event, in both skiing and snowboarding forms, at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.</p></center>

<h3> <center> <id= "subsection5"> Halfpipe Skiing </id> </center> </h3>
    <center> <p> Halfpipe skiing is the sport of riding snow skis on a half-pipe. Competitors gradually ski to the end of the pipe by doing flips and tricks.
         It became an Olympic event for the first time at the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Four years after the discovery of the world's first half-pipe,
         Tom Sims organized the first World Championships at Soda Springs, California where the first man-made half-pipe was constructed. The first half-pipe championships
         experienced difficulties constructing a perfect half-pipe, as it had never been done before. Eventually, Sims moved it towards the bottom of the resort to make it
         less steep and more ride able for snowboarders controlling their speed. In 1986, the World Championship moved to Breckenridge, Colorado. Again, they were met with trouble
         constructing the half-pipe, as the employees in Breckenridge had never constructed and few had ever seen a half-pipe. After the competition the half-pipe remained for use,
         becoming the first permanent pipe at a resort and began spreading the awareness of half-pipes. By 1988, half-pipes had become media magnets. From all over the world, magazines,
         television shows, and newspapers wanted to do stories on the perceived, insane snowboarders riding the half-pipe.</p></center>

<h3> <center> <id= "subsection6"> Equipment </id> </center> </h3>
    <center> <p> Twin-tip skis are used in events such as slopestyle and halfpipe. Mogul skis are used in moguls and sometimes in aerials.
         Specially designed racing skis are used in ski cross. Ski bindings took a major design change to include plate bindings mounted to
         the bottom of the skiers boot to allow for multi-directional release. Ski poles are a staple in the all aspects of freestyle skiing,
         however, slopestyle athletes have more recently opted to ski without them in order to free their hands for grabs and other personal 
         preferences in their riding. </p> </center> <br>
